### Minecraft
To utilize the minecraft command for both Mods and Datapacks, the command should be used as such;

FOR MODS:
* `bmcm -md <mod-name>`

FOR DATAPACKS:
* `bmcm -dp <data-pack> <world-name>`
  Be careful with the datapack command, incorrect ordering can lead to failed installations, and a headache for you to solve. So, make sure you follow this order correctly and do not mix up flags or arguments.

Uninstallation of mods and datapacks will be done through a selection menu in the terminal to prevent the accidental deltion of other mods or folders. For now, it is manual
