# Bears-Mod-Manager
Starting out on minecraft and then to steam games. Terminal command, and later graphical menu made to ease the somewhat tedious installation of mods for many games.

### Current Plan
- [ ] Reorganize
- [ ] GUI
  - Mod Tracking
  - Visual Removal and addition to games
  - Easily switch between what games you are installing mods for.
- [ ] Better Logging
- [ ] Extra Flags
- [ ] Configuration files for different games
- [ ] Mod Backups
- [ ] Documentation for commands

### Game Support
- [X] Minecraft (Partially (Mods))
- [ ] Minecraft (Fully (Mods and Datapacks))
- [ ] Cold Waters
- [ ] Open Rails
- [ ] Run8 Liveries
- [ ] **Steel Fury Kharkov 1942** (Will have its own documentation made later on for more information regarding this.)

### Game Requests
It would be very appreciated for ideas on what games to support. Make an issue and I'll check it out and respond as quickly as possible.

### Sneak-Peaks (sort of)
Very soon some documentation is to come! (For minecraft at least) This can be seen in the [.gitignore file.](./.gitignore)
